## Usage

Using ProgressUI is straightforward. Here's a simple example:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import ProgressUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var progress: CGFloat = 0.5

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            CircularProgressView(progress: progress)
                .frame(width: 100, height: 100)
                .padding()
            
            Slider(value: $progress, in: 0...1)
                .padding()
        }
    }
}
```

This example shows a circular progress view with a slider to control the progress. Adjust the `progress` variable to see the indicator change in real-time.
